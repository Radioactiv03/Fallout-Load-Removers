# FalloutNV-Load-remover

This is a rework of the Fallout: New Vegas load remover.
This was needed as a small proportion of the community was having issues with the fallout process not fully closing and thus the load remover stopped working
This fixes the issue by checking the process list and terminating all FalloutNV processes when it detects more than 2
Hopefully it works :)


The Fallout 3 load remover has also been updated to add similar features to NV
